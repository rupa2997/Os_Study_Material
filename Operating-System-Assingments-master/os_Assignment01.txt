	b) Display line numbers along with content
                   -- cat -n file13.txt
	c) Display the file in reverse order using tac
               -- tac file13.txt
	d) Combine multiple files using cat command
                -- cat file1.txt file2.txt >file3.txt

Q5. Create Random some files and sub directories.
	a) display files row wise, column wise, 1 per row
	b) sort the files in ascending, descending order
                -- sort file1.txt
                -- sort –r file1.txt
	c) Create some hidden files and sub directories and display them using “ls -a”
	d) Change time stamp of some files and directories using touch command and display the files using ls -t ls –rt
          --touch -d "today 1 day" file.txt
        --ls -lh
	e) Recursive display contents of your home directory.
                -- ls –R
               --  du –a
              -- find dir/ -print  (give path of all the files)
	f) display all attributes of files and directories using ls -l
	g) display attributes of a directory using ls –ld
                   --ls –ld ( used for to know the permissions)
                 -- ls –m –(allthe files separated by commas)
--ls –X (sort Entry by extensions)
 --ls –A (used to show all hidden files)-exclude . .. fliles
--ls –a A (used to show all hidden files)-include . .. files

Q1. Create directory of your name and then create 4 files inside it named
             -- mkdir Rupali -- cd Rupali
	a.txt, b.txt, c.txt and d.sh. And change the directory permission to
	only user and also files permission to only user such that
		a)user can read and write the file a.txt and b.txt
                                    chmod +rw a.txt b.txt
		b)user can write the file c.txt
                                chmod +w c.txt
		c)user can exectuable the file d.sh. Make
			Contents of file d.sh:
chmod +x d.sh
cat d.sh
			#/bin/sh
			ls -lh
Q2. Change the permission of the previous directory to executable only.
	Analyze the output.
chmod +x Rupali
Q3. Change the permission of the previous directory to read only.
	Analyze the output.
chmod -x Rupali
Q4. Use echo to list the all files of your home directory.
Q5. Use echo to list the all files of /etc/ directory
Q6. Use echo to list the all files of /etc/ directory with extension name .conf
find /etc/ -name "*.conf"
Q7. Use echo to append your name to a.txt
 --echo "Hello----rupali" >>a.txt

==================================================================================

Note:Many operation might not work.Analyze them
1.	Create Three level nested directory a,b and c
mkdir a
cd a
cat > a.txt
mkdir b
cd b
cat > b.txt
mkdir c
cd c
cat > c.txt

a)Create at least one hidden file in each directory
touch .rupali
b)Create at least one normal text file in each directory
c)Copy c into a
cp -r c a
d)Copy file inside a into b	
cp a.txt b
cp -r cdac/*  a9

2.	Change the third level directory c permission to read only
chmod +r c
3.	Try copying third level c directory to outside of a
cp c a
4.	Create the directory  “data“ inside b
  mkdir  data
5.	Change the permission of b to read and write only
   chmod +rw b
6.	Create directory “data2”  inside b
mkdir data2.
7.	Create data.txt file inside b
    cat > data.txt
8.	Rename the second level directory c to copied_dir
   mv c copied_dir
9.	Change permission of copied_dir to only executable
chmod +x copied_dir
10.	Try ls on copied_dir
11.	Try moving copied_dir to outside of a
  cp copied_dir a
12.	Try moving data directory outside of a
 mv /home/rupali/Rupali/a.txt     /home/rupali
13.	Now change the owner of the directory a to root
chown -R root a
14.	Change permission of a to read write and executable to only user

19.	Change group of movies to sudo
Chgrp sudo movies
20.	Change group of movies to avahi
21.	Try changing permission after changing ownership to root
22.	Try Changing permission after changing group to sudo without sudo
