Q3. A) Create five files file1.txt , file2.txt ,file3.txt file4.txt and
    file5.txt with some text inside it. Search for 's' character
    inside all the files using grep command.
    Also Use cat to view all file content together.

	> touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt 
	> grep "s" *.txt
	> cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt

	B)Create file.txt using cat and edit that using nano editor.

	> cat > file.txt 
	> nano file.txt

	c)Create 5 empty files using touch command

	> touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt

	
	D)Remove previously created directory a , b and c.

	> rm -r a c

Q4. Create a file with some content using vi editor
	a) Display the file using cat command
	
	> vi file1.txt
	> cat file1.txt

	b) Display line numbers along with content

	> cat -n file1.txt

	c) Display the file in reverse order using tac

	> tac file1.txt

	d) Combine multiple files using cat command

	> cat file1.txt >> file3.txt


Q5. Create Random some files and sub directories.

	a) display files row wise, column wise, 1 per row

	> ls -1
	> ls

	b) sort the files in ascending, descending order

	> ls -1   (sort by name asc)
	> ls -1 -r (sort by name desc)
	> ls -al -S (sort by size desc)
	> ls -al -Sr <sort by size asc)

	c) Create some hidden files and sub directories and display them using “ls -a”
	
	> touch .adi.txt
	> ls -a

	d) Change time stamp of some files and directories using touch command and display the files using ls -t ls -rt
	
	> touch -t file2.txt

	e) Recursive display contents of your home directory.

	> ls -R

	f) display all attributes of files and directories using ls -l

	> ls -l

	g) display attributes of a directory using ls -ld
	
	> ls -ld

==================================================================================
Q1. Create directory of your name and then create 4 files inside it named
	a.txt, b.txt, c.txt and d.sh. And change the directory permission to
	only user and also files permission to only user such that

		> chmod a-rwx a.txt b.txt

		a)user can read and write the file a.txt and b.txt

		> chmod u+rw a.txt b.txt

		b)user can write the file c.txt

		> chmod u+w c.txt

		c)user can exectuable the file d.sh. Make
			Contents of file d.sh:
			#/bin/sh
			ls -lh

		> chmod u+x d.sh
		> vi d.sh
		> bash d.sh

Q2. Change the permission of the previous directory to executable only.
	Analyze the output.

> chmod a+x ../

Q3. Change the permission of the previous directory to read only.
	Analyze the output.

> chmod a+r ../

Q4. Use echo to list the all files of your home directory.

> echo *

Q5. Use echo to list the all files of /etc/ directory

> echo */*

Q6. Use echo to list the all files of /etc/ directory with extension name .conf

> echo *.conf

Q7. Use echo to append your name to a.txt

> echo "Yash" >> data.txt

==================================================================================

Note:Many operation might not work.Analyze them
1.	Create Three level nested directory a,b and c
a)Create at least one hidden file in each directory

> mkdir -p a/b/c

b)Create at least one normal text file in each directory

> touch filea.txt ./b/fileb.txt ./b/c/filec.txt

c)Copy c into a

> cp -r b/c ./

d)Copy file inside a into b

> cp filea.txt b/

2.	Change the third level directory c permission to read only

	> chmod a+r b/c
 
3.	Try copying third level c directory to outside of a

	> cp b/c ../

4.	Create the directory  “data“ inside b

	> mkdir b/data

5.	Change the permission of b to read and write only

	> chmod u+rw b

6.	Create directory “data2”  inside b

	> mkdir b/data2

7.	Create data.txt file inside b
	
	> touch b/data.txt

8.	Rename the second level directory c to copied_dir

	> mv b/c a

9.	Change permission of copied_dir to only executable

	> chmod u+x b/c

10.	Try ls on copied_dir

	> ls cannot run because of executable only cannot read

11.	Try moving copied_dir to outside of a

	> cannot move dir to outside because of restriced permissions

12.	Try moving data directory outside of a

	> cannot move, permission access denied

13.	Now change the owner of the directory a to root

	sudo chown -R root: /home/


14.	Change permission of a to read write and executable to only user

	> chmod u+rwx a

15.	Try creating directory sample inside a

	> mkdir a/d

16.	Create directory x outside a

	> mkdir ../x

17.	Try moving x inside a

	> mv x ./a

18.	Create directory movies

	> mkdir movies

19.	Change group of movies to sudo

	> sudo chgrp yashgrp /movies/


20.	Change group of movies to avahi

	> chgrp avahi /movies/
	
	 
21.	Try changing permission after changing ownership to root

	> sudo chmod --recursive a+rwx /tmp


22.	Try Changing permission after changing group to sudo without sudo

	> pkexec chmod go-w /usr/lib/sudo/sudoers.so


23.	Try Changing owner and group both to root

	> sudo chown -R yash:root
	  sudo chgrp yashgrp root

24.	Try changinging permission

	> sudo usermod -aG sudo newuser

25.	Try deleting the file

	> rm -rf a.txt
